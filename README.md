# Beat Me Alive
Beat Me Alive is a self-hosted or cloud-deployable heartbeat monitoring platform that gives you a real-time view of your infrastructure health. It runs periodic checks (ping, SSH, or TCP) to determine whether your virtual machines or physical nodes are online. With a centralized backend, REST API, and modern dashboard, Beat Me Alive helps DevOps engineers, sysadmins, and developers keep track of which instances are live — and take action when they’re not.

- Key features include:
- Per-minute instance health checks
- Live frontend dashboard
- Database-backed status tracking

Lightweight, extensible, and easy to integrate

Whether you're running 5 VMs or 500, let Beat Me Alive keep a pulse on your infrastructure.
